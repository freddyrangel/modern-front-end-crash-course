# Modern Front End Development Crash Course

## Requirements:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  * NVM is the easiest way to manage Node. [Its setup instructions
    here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation). Then run `nvm install
node && nvm alias default node`, which installs the latest version of Node.js
and sets up your terminal so you can run it by typing `node`. With nvm you can
install multiple versions of Node.js and easily switch between them.
  * New to [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/)?
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
  * If you're on a Mac, you can install Yarn 2 different ways: `npm i -g yarn`
    or `brew install yarn`
* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
  * `npm install -g create-react-app`
